# scRNA
The pipeline requires the following:

1.  
In the working directory there should be the R-project file, a csv file with a list of genes you wish to analyze, and a              folder named ‘00. Packages for pipeline’. In this folder you will place one folder per condition with .tsv files of transcript counts.

2.  
The required packages can be found in the script '00. Required packages".  

3.  
In order for the pipeline to work, you will also need to source RacdeID3_StemID2 which is created by Dominik Grun.
